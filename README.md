# Locky

The Locky android application development was split into three cycles; internet of things, backend server management, and blockchain which was overseen by several final-year students for 9 months. Our team was assigned to develop the backend, in which Google Firebase was implemented to store data and handle user login.

## Functions
* A Bluetooth connection is established between the android app and the physical locker, permitting data interaction through a string sent by the gateway
* The lockers have in-built sensors to determine current availability and we programmed the retrieved data to be stored onto our cloud Firebase, a database platform backed by Google
* For maximizing our app's security and maintaining users' trust,  we turned to the best technology. Once stored in the blockchain, data cannot be manipulated.
* Developed in Android Studio using Java
